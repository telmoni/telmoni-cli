# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Telmoni CLI is currently pre-release. Security patches are applied to the active development branch (`main`).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `main`  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1.0 | :white_check_mark: |

Once versioned releases are tagged (starting with `v0.1.0`), this table will reflect supported release lines and backport windows.

## Scope

Security vulnerability reports are welcome for:
- The `telmoni` CLI application (`src/`).
- Client SDK libraries and scaffolds (`sdk/`).
- Authentication flows, local token storage, and credential handling.

Issues in upstream dependencies are evaluated based on exploitability within the CLI.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.**

We offer two private channels for reporting:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred):**  
   Use GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/telmoni/telmoni-cli/security/advisories/new) under the repository's **Security > Advisories** tab.

2. **Email:**  
   Send details to **hello@telmoni.com**.

When reporting, please provide:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or a minimal proof of concept (PoC).
- The commit SHA or version tested against.
- Any proposed remediation, if known.

## Response & Disclosure Timeline

- **Initial Response:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within three working days.
- **Triage & Status:** We will keep you informed of our investigation, confirmation status, and planned timeline for shipping a fix.
- **Coordinated Disclosure:** We request that you give us a reasonable window to remediate the vulnerability before public disclosure.
- **Bug Bounty:** There is currently no paid bug bounty programme.

## Testing Guidelines & Safe Harbor

When testing for vulnerabilities:
- Test only against accounts or test environments you own and control.
- Do not attempt to access, view, or modify data belonging to other accounts.
- Do not degrade the performance of any shared or hosted services.

We consider vulnerability research conducted in compliance with these guidelines to be authorized and will not initiate legal action against researchers acting in good faith.
